# PRESENTING YOUR CASE
## FOLDER
### WHAT CAN YOU USE IT FOR?
If the police or the prosecutor is investigating your case, you should give the folder to them, to support the investigation. You can also give the folder to any organizations that are helping you develop your case. Finally, the folder can be a useful part of your asylum application.
### WHAT TO INCLUDE <summary>

+ Cover Letter
+ Personal Statement - written by you
+ Timeline of Events
+ Supporting statements - written by other people to support your case
+ Anything else that may be relevant e.g. journal entries
#### DETAILED
Make sure you properly number and label different sections of your folder so it is easier to show others and for them to browse it.
##### Some tips to keep in mind:
+ Do not print smaller than font size of 12.
+ If possible, print out 3-4 copies so you have 4 identical folders. Hide one away in a safe spot if it’s safe for you to do, or give it to someone you trust.
+ Keep digital copies of everything and email them to several email addresses and some people you trust. If you don’t know who to trust, send this evidence to any NGO or organisation that is assisting you. You can also create a password protected account on Dropbox.

## COVER LETTER
### WHAT TO INCLUDE <summary>
+ Who you are
+ Why are you submitting this case / what is it for?
+ What the evidence suggests
+ Why you collected the evidence
+ An appendix of the different kind of documents included in the folder

#### DETAILED
The cover letter is a way of introducing your case, and the evidence, to the reader. Please be as concise and specific as possible. Focus on highlighting the most important information: who you are, why you are writing to them, what evidence you collected and what does it show.

When introducing yourself, stay very brief. Just state your name, your status, and the reason why you are writing this letter and presenting the evidence. The introduction should not be longer than 1-2 lines.

At this point, do not get into details of describing or explaining your evidence. Instead, say something like: “The evidence I collected, in the form of documents, audio evidence, as well as witness statements, clearly shows the abusive nature of the relationship, and supports my need to escape it for my own safety.” The details can come in the personal statement section.

#### TEMPLATE/EXAMPLE
See the Appendix.

## PERSONAL STATEMENT
### WHAT TO INCLUDE <summary>
+ Write in first person. Use “I” rather than she/he.
+ First paragraph: Briefly describe your situation - are you in an abusive relationship, have you escaped it, what is your current position etc. Then, state clearly what you are applying for: e.g. divorce, domestic violence or harassment conviction, asylum, child custody, etc.
+ Chronological narration of events. 
    + Only include main and significant events. You can write one paragraph to state how your usual day went with enough detail for the reader to understand without going into depth about every incident that occurred. 
    + Describe your cultural and other relevant contexts - for example, your family situation, background or local trends, happenings and customs etc. The person reading the document may have little understanding of the significance of some things to you, so always make it clear why what you are describing is important.
    + Talk about and explain evidence you may be attaching elsewhere, including hearsay and original evidence (see above) where relevant.
    + Add quotes in quotation marks and always describe cultural context.
    
See detailed section for examples.
#### DETAILED
Personal statement is the space in which you can explain your situation in more detail. Use it to explain your current situation with relation to your abuser (have you escaped, are you still in the abusive relationship, do you have any children with your abuser etc.), as well as what you are applying for and **what you need specifically** from the person you are writing to. The more concrete you can make your request, the more likely they are to be able to help you.

Make sure you always explain the cultural, personal, social and other contexts in which the described events took place. Even though you should aim to be brief and concise, it is helpful to include one sentence **explaining why a given event/piece of evidence is important**, to help the reader understand your perspective, even if they don’t have an understanding of your cultural and personal background.

For example, if your society does not approve of women working once they get married, this can be an important piece of cultural context. It brings out the issue of financial dependence, and might contribute to explaining why some of your choices, that would otherwise seem “consensual” were in fact coerced and an element of the abusive relationship. An element of a personal context can be jealousy or possessiveness of the partner. It can explain why you felt threatened in certain situations and provides important context for other elements of abuse. In other words, any piece of context can be relevant, even if it seems unimportant to you!

When describing the events, you can start with a brief description of what your day-to-day life looked like. This is to help the reader understand the context in which the other events occurred. Make sure to illustrate what your life looked like, and why you felt scared, powerless, or threatened, without going into too much detail of the everyday events.

Following that, choose the most significant, main events, and present them in a chronological order. Provide only the details that help you build your case/illustrate the abusive nature of your relationship. Although it is important to be precise, if you make your account too long and detailed, it might be more difficult for the reader to comprehend. Wherever relevant, explain the context (see above), and refer to evidence that you provide elsewhere. This includes hearsay. You can refer to things people said, always making it clear who said it. For example, you can include it if you heard your mother-in-law say your husband will find you and kill you or if your relatives tell you that your partner has been spreading slanderous lies about you. Try and note down the date these things were said as this gives clarity to the person reading it. 

This is your space to present your story. You should use your own words and describe the events as you experienced them, rather than language that is overly scientific or detached. However, try to focus on facts, rather than emotions. You can mention how the abuse made you feel, but be sure to keep your statement focused on what happened. Below are examples of sentences that are (1) too impersonal; (2) too emotional; (3) well-balanced.
##### Overly impersonal description of abuse:
> “In 2015, the situation deteriorated. He used physical and other forms of violence against me. When I attempted to notify the authorities, the abuser would use force to prevent me from doing so.” 

> “He repeatedly used insulting language when referring to me and our son. He used threats to prevent me from notifying other people of my situation”

###### These statements:
+ Sound unnatural and forced, do not provide a flowing narrative
+ Use overly formal language
+ Downplay the abuse: saying “He used insulting language” does not necessarily show the effect the verbal abuse had on you and why it was abuse - it is important to stress that. **_Insulting you IS abuse and how it made you feel IS important!_**

##### Overly emotional description of abuse:
> “After some time, it all got so bad, I thought I couldn’t stand it anymore. I cried and cried all the time and felt completely powerless. He was beating and kicking me and I felt like dying, so scared all the time. He did things that made me feel worthless and humiliated. I felt very scared and couldn’t even contact the police.”

> “The way he talked to me always made me feel very scared and sad and depressed. He also said many things that made me terrified about my safety”
###### These statements:
+ Are too vague - they do not provide specific examples or dates of the events
+ Focus on emotions rather than facts - it can distract the reader from your narrative of events
+ Are too repetitive and do not add enough new content

##### Balanced descriptions of abuse, including account of facts and emotions:
> “In 2015, the situation got much worse. He beat, kicked and slapped me so much that I felt like I couldn’t take it any longer. On one occasion, he got particularly violent and I was afraid he was going to kill me. I reached for the phone to try to dial the police number, but he slapped the phone out of my hand and spat on my face, calling me a bitch”

> “He repeatedly called me a bitch and a whore, forbidding me to see my friends and accusing me of cheating on him. This language made me feel very threatened and vulnerable. On one occasion, in June 2014, when I came back from a meeting with a friend, he threatened to kill me if I tried to contact someone from outside of our house again.”

###### These statements:
+ Form a narrative - they show the events in a sequence, but also show their personal effect on you and how you felt about them
+ Clearly show how and when the abuse happened - whether it was physical or verbal, explaining the events and how you felt about them shows the nature of your relationship
+ Are specific about the dates and types of abuse
