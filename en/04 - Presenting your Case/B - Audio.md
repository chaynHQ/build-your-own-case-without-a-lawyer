### DETAILED
Although photographic, audio, and video evidence can be very useful for your case, it is important to bear in mind that it is often not self-explanatory. A recording taken out of the context can be misleading, or interpreted in different, sometimes contradictory, ways. That’s why it is always important to include a description of the recording: explain when and in what context it happened (e.g. was it at home, on the street, what happened directly before the recording etc.), how you recorded it, and who can be heard in the recording. Since recordings are not always clear, it is also important to provide transcripts - both in the original language, and a translation. It would be best if the translation could be done by a professional. However, it can also be done by you, or someone you know. Make  clear who made the translation and include their ID and contact information. If the translation is incorrect by someone, highlight that with a highlighter and then write a separate note explaining what was interpreted or translated incorrectly. It may also be useful to find online or offline sources with the correct use or translation of the word to bolster your case e.g. news article, dictionary or any book.

Audio evidence can support your claim in multiple ways. It can document the abuse itself, but it can also be a recording of a conversation with the use of threats or violent and abusive language. Collecting audio evidence is extremely important; however, it can also put you at risk. Thus, while it is advisable to start collecting evidence, including audio evidence, as early as possible, you should be careful and always put your safety first!

Even if you have left the relationship or are away from the abuser, you can record calls to use as evidence. For instance, if your abuser is calling you - ignore their calls for a while and then pick it up. They will have a lot of pent-up energy and anger which they would display on the call - record it e.g. using a recording function on your mobile phone, or a dedicated app. Mention specific incidents where they wronged you - trying to get them to either reveal their abusive nature or to admit that they wronged you. Encouraging someone to reveal the abuse they did to you is not wrong. You can do the same thing with your family, in-laws and anyone else who has wronged you. If you think your partner would suspect you of recording the call, then you can also enlist the help of a common contact who you trust and know is on your side.

The recording can be done using small recorder devices or on a mobile phone/laptop. Recording devices can usually be bought quite cheaply online or from any shop. These can come in concealed or ‘secret’ forms. For example; they may appear to be a standard USB stick, jewelry box, pen or teddy bear. If you don’t know how to obtain such a device, you can talk to someone you trust about it. When recording the evidence, make sure your abuser does not see the device. You can hide it somewhere in the house/venue, or on your person. However, please put your own safety first. Nothing is more important than your wellbeing! You can also ask someone else, for example a friend or a neighbor, to record evidence of abuse if they hear it.

Once you record the evidence, make sure you store it safely. If your device creates digital files, save them in several copies, under names that do not suggest the content, and store a hard copy on a USB stick in a safe place. If the device only produces cassettes, hide it in a safe place, or give it to a trusted person.

If you are unsure about the legal aspect of recording this, then don’t fear. Record it anyway. Later if you find out you can use it, even if just to persuade the police, an NGO, a loved one or lawyer to take up your case - then it will come in very handy.

### EXAMPLES
> “I started recording the conversations I had with my abusers after coming to the conclusion that I had no choice but to make their hypocrisy and their ill-treatment of me public. They seemed to thrive under the cover that my inaction in this regard was providing them. I decided to overcome the shame, the humiliation and embarrassment that I was experiencing at their hands because I needed to take control of my own life and my circumstances. But most of all, I wanted to have evidence to back up my side of the story because they had a habit of making me out to be a liar to the authorities. I needed to break that cycle.” **A brave woman, 26**
