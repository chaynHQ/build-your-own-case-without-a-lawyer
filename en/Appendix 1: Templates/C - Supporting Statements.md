###TEMPLATE FOR PERSONAL STATEMENT
This template has two components (1) Guidance (2) Example. 

*All paragraphs in the personal statement are numbered so you can refer to paragraphs rather than saying third paragraph on page X.* 

If you can remember the dates of different events exactly, please include them. However, if you only remember the year or the month, it is also ok. Try to be as specific as you can, but remember - the events matter even if you don’t remember the exact date when they happened!

#####2. This paragraph is for explaining the REASON FOR CLAIM.
#####3. Explain the HISTORY OF THE RELATIONSHIP OF ABUSE in this paragraph. When did the marriage take place? Where? With Whom? Was it of your own choice? When you were born (if parents are abusers)?
Example: *“I got married to her when I was 21. I had been in a series of unsuccessful relationships in my late teens. My first serious relationship (June -Dec 2007) ended abruptly as I caught my partner sleeping with my best friend. My next relationship (March - Nov 2008) ended because my partner was distant and showed no interest in what I liked. I met M when I was 20. Some of my friends were settled in long-term relationships and I craved companionship. My friend, S, who also took Spanish classes in the evening with me said she would set me up with a girl she lives with (M). I had only known S for a few months (Jan - July 2009) but thought it was worth meeting M. M and I had our first date in a restaurant and found we both liked the same movies and foods. I was relieved to meet a woman who was caring and seemed loyal, with quite a strong personality - but I didn’t mind. At that time, it was nice to be with someone who was not afraid to commit and gave me time. Little did I know that she was going to turn out to be an abuser who caused me pain, depression and led me to consider killing myself.”
#####4. FIRST INSTANCE OF ABUSE /s from here. Put these in chronological order and break these into numbered paragraphs. Include one major event per paragraph and as many details as you can remember and cite evidence attached if any of it corroborates what you say.
>“The first signs of abuse began shortly after we got married. He was very demanding, got angry very easily, and constantly made me feel guilty about not giving him enough attention, or not being a good wife. No matter how hard I tried to fulfil all his wishes, he would always find a way to complain and make me feel bad about myself. Sometimes he would call me lazy, useless. Once, after I came back home after meeting a friend, he called me a whore. A few days after the wedding, we were getting ready to go out with his parents. As I was getting dressed, my mother-in-law walked into the room and told me to wear a dress she liked. As we were already late, I told her I would wear it another day.  My mother in-law shot a look at my husband and walked out. I said I was sorry, but he called me ‘an ungrateful, ill-mannered bitch’ and told me to get changed, raising his hand in anger. I cowered. I was in shock. I changed into the other dress and thought this was due to the pressure of new marriage. I didn’t tell anyone about it. I suppressed my tears. The next week, he cursed me again and then afterwards, the mental torture and physical abuse became routine.The first weeks after the marriage were suffocating - I was feeling worthless, depressed and I was being constantly degraded. At the time, I did not realise that the verbal aggression and possessiveness were signs of abuse. With time, he also started using physical abuse - first he pushed me away when I was trying to set the table for dinner, criticising me and calling a useless bitch. Sometimes he would slap me when he got angry. Over the weeks, and later months, the beatings got more severe and often I had to stay home to disguise the bruises.”
#####FIRST TIME YOU DISCLOSED THE ABUSE TO SOMEBODY
>“One night in summer 2014, it could have been the last weeks of June, after my husband got home from work, he started getting very angry on little things. He was not happy that I was speaking to my mother when he walked in. I told him I take a lot of his misbehaviour but he had no right to control when I spoke to my mother. He got really angry at this and threw a glass at me. He called many abusive names and also called my parents abuses like “prostitute, cunt, bastard”. I started crying so he took me by my hair - and dragged me on the floor. He ripped my shirt open and banged my head against the floor. My head started bleeding so I tried to resist and pushed him back. He punched me in my face and kicked until I stopped fighting. He left the house, locking me in and told me he would kill me if I called the police. That night, I felt he was going to kill me so I called my mother. She was shocked at this. She asked me why I had not told her this before. I told her that she had told me before I got married that it is my duty to make the marriage work and if I complained about things not working out, people would say ‘her mother had not taught her how to be a good wife’.  My mother told me ‘to be patient and pray to God. He will make things work. Whatever is in your fate will happen.’ I pleaded with her to get me out but she simply told me to accept my fate.”
