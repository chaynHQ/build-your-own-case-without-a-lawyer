My name is [YOUR NAME] I am [YOUR AGE] years old and I currently reside at  [WHERE DO YOU LIVE]. I am writing to you to set out my case [TO OBTAIN A DIVORCE FROM MY HUSBAND – NAME; TO OBTAIN AN ASYLUM IN – COUNTRY NAME etc. Whatever it is that you’re asking for!].
 
For the last [X] year/months, my [HUSBAND/PARENT/RELATIONSHIP WITH ABUSER] has been abusing me. His/Her/Their name is [NAME] of [FULL ADDRESS/ID INFORMATION]. The continuous abuse and physical, verbal and emotional violence have made me fear for my life and the life of my children. [YOU SHOULD CUSTOMIZE THIS SENTENCE TO MATCH YOUR EXPERIENCE BUT DO STRESS THAT YOU ARE THREATENED BY THE PERPETRATOR]. I have collected evidence, presented in this folder, to document the abuse I have experienced.
 
The evidence, in the form of [LIST TYPES OF EVIDENCE YOU ATTACH: OFFICIAL STATEMENTS AND REPORTS, AUDIO FILES DOCUMENTING ABUSE, PHOTOS OF THE INJURIES, PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE OF CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN YOU, YOUR ABUSER, HIS FAMILY ETC.,], as well as the supporting statements from [WHO PROVIDED THE STATEMENTS] show the nature of my relationship with [NAME], documents the violent acts committed against me. The evidence makes it clear that my fear for my life is well founded and legitimate. Therefore, it supports my request for [WHAT YOU ARE REQUESTING: ASYLUM/DIVORCE/CHILD CUSTODY], as a way of escaping my abuser.
 
Please find below the list of evidence provided. I trust that, upon revising it, you will appreciate the difficult situation I find myself in, and consider my request for [WHAT ARE YOU REQUESTING] positively.
