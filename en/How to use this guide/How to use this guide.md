#IS THIS GUIDE FOR ME?
If you are a victim of any form of domestic violence or abuse, and have limited access to resources, you can use this guide as a tool to help build a case against the perpetrator without having to spend money for legal counsel.  You can find more information about what constitutes domestic violence and abuse below, as well as on the Chayn, Chayn India and Chayn Pakistan websites. Although this guide is meant primarily for those suffering from domestic violence, you may still find sections of this guide useful if you’ve endured or are enduring any injustice. If you’re worried about someone close to you, you can use this guide to help them.

**In one line:** _this guide tells you how to build your own case if any injustice is being/has been done to you, without the help of a lawyer._

Although it is a useful tool in collecting evidence and building your case, and can help you reclaim your rights without legal counsel, the guide **cannot fully replace specific legal advice** relevant to your case. Therefore, if you can afford legal counsel or are appointed one, please make sure to make the best use of it. If you sought legal counsel, but were refused help, this guide can help you convince a lawyer to take your case, by collecting and presenting your evidence.

If you are **unsure whether you want to take legal action**, you can still use this guide to collect evidence and keep it safe in case you need it in the future.

Some of the language in this guide may seem like it is written just for women but in reality it can be used to help anyone facing domestic violence in both heterosexual and same sex marriages and relationships. The information also applies to you if you are facing **abuse from your parents** or siblings.

The general advice we provide in this guide is designed to help you build your case, aid in holding the perpetrator accountable, and exercise your rights wherever you live. The Chayn team is also working to develop country-specific guides, which will provide more detailed information on the legal and cultural framework and ways to get help in particular countries.

In some countries, you may be eligible for free legal advice provided under a Legal Aid scheme. However, there are number of resources at the back of this guide that can assist you in seeking legal help. If there is no information about your country, then you can turn to a local NGO (Non-Governmental Organisation/charity) - even if they do not have experience or expertise in domestic violence cases, they can still point you in the right direction.

### What can you use the guide for?
This guide aims to help you exercise your right to:
+ take legal action against the perpetrator
+ escape an abusive relationship
+ get a divorce
+ secure child custody
+ apply for asylum
+ any other scenario where you need to prove the abuse you faced
+ for your own record.

Legal systems and procedures can be complex, slow, and rigid. We strongly believe that preparing the right evidence and presenting it well will enable you to effectively overcome these obstacles. 

There are many instances where bringing a criminal case against your abuser is not feasible or is dangerous for you. In that instance, use this guide to make a case for your own record. You never know when you may need it. 

If the Police are bringing a criminal case against an individual or individuals who have committed or are currently committing abuse against you, you should provide them with all the information this guide has helped you collect. The Police will also obtain information which they need and might interview you to ensure that they have your personal evidence/statement.  If you can, obtain a restraining order. If the police are unwilling to investigate your case, you can turn to organizations that help victims of domestic violence bring their cases to court, through civil, criminal, or community court. Depending on where you are, there might be a list of useful organisations available [here](http://chayn.co/).

The section on presenting the information will be most helpful to you if you are putting together a case relating to their immigration status and other agencies. However, you can also use this section to present your case to the Police, the Prosecutor, or any organisation assisting you, in order to maximise the chances of their involvement in your case, even if  they are initially unwilling to.

You may have suffered abuse, are working through a legacy of abuse, or are still working through abuse right now. It's important to remember that you don’t deserve to be oppressed, you deserve respect. 

You take real action towards making a future for yourself in the present by seeking help from people and resources like this guide that uphold your rights.

## WHAT IS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE?
Domestic violence is a type of mistreatment and includes physical, sexual, or psychological abuse. There are different types of domestic violence: it can occur in a lot of different ways, and it can happen to anyone, in any kind of relationship. 

If another person’s actions put physical, psychological, or emotional strain on you, or if you feel hurt in any way and at any time, you might be experiencing abuse. Abuse is a recurring phenomenon and can be inflicted by anyone including your partner, parents, siblings, children, relatives, and in-laws. You can find more information about what constitutes domestic violence and abuse below, as well as on the [here](http://chayn.co/), [Chayn India](http://chaynindia.com/) and  [Chayn Pakistan](http://chaynpakistan.org/) websites.

While there is no internationally agreed definition of domestic violence, and different countries have different definitions, for women, United Nations defines “violence” as “any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering”.  Some countries extend this definition, and recognise that emotional harm and financial control can be part of this abuse, as well as ‘honour’ based violence, Female Genital Mutilation, and forced marriage. In some cultural contexts, forced/child marriage or marital rape can be very controversial issues. Regardless of where you live, you should collect evidence of any such events - they can prove useful in building your case later on.
If you are facing any of the above forms of abuse from your intimate partner, family or in-laws: whether physical, sexual, psychological, emotional, or financial, this guide has been created for you. It is designed to help you collect and present evidence of the abuse. Collecting evidence is extremely important - you can use it when filing for divorce, pressing criminal charges against the perpetrator, or applying for asylum.

While you should not rely on this guide to win a case or as the only guide for every legal scenario, it can be a helpful resource for you. If you seek legal help, this should speed up the process of preparing your case. 

We’ve put as much information as we can in the guide. If at any point you feel overwhelmed, close this guide. Take a break. Come back to it and start again when you feel you can. You will be fine.
